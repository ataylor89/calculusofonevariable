Chapter 1 Section 1
Problem 1. Let A = {1,5,7,10} and B={2,7,11,14}. Determine A ∪ B, A ∩ B, A \ B, B \ A, (A \ B) ∪ B, and (A \ B) ∪ (A ∩ B).
Solution. 
A ∪ B = {1,2,5,7,10,11,14} 
A ∩ B = {7}
A \ B = {1,5,10}
B \ A = {2,11,14}
(A \ B) ∪ B = {1,2,5,7,10,11,14}
(A \ B) ∪ (A ∩ B) = {1,5,7,10} 
Problem 2. The preceding problem should suggest two set identities. Write them, and illustrate them with diagrams. 
Solution.
(A \ B) ∪ B = A ∪ B
(A \ B) ∪ (A ∩ B) = A
