<h1>Calculus Of One Variable</h1>
<h3>Chapter 1 Section 1</h3>
<p><b>Problem 1</b> Let A = {1,5,7,10} and B={2,7,11,14}. Determine A ∪ B, A ∩ B, A \ B, B \ A, (A \ B) ∪ B, and (A \ B) ∪ (A ∩ B).</p>
<p>Solution 
<pre>
A ∪ B = {1,2,5,7,10,11,14} 
A ∩ B = {7}
A \ B = {1,5,10}
B \ A = {2,11,14}
(A \ B) ∪ B = {1,2,5,7,10,11,14}
(A \ B) ∪ (A ∩ B) = {1,5,7,10} 
</pre>
</p>
<p><b>Problem 2</b> The preceding problem should suggest two set identities. Write them, and illustrate them with diagrams.</p>
<p>Solution
<pre>
(A \ B) ∪ B = A ∪ B
(A \ B) ∪ (A ∩ B) = A
</pre>
</p>
<p><b>Problem 3</b> Let S={1,2,3}. List all the members of S(S). If S is a set containing n elements, make a guess as to the number of elements in S(S).</p>
<p>Solution
<pre> 
S(S) = {{}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}}. S(S) has 8 members.
This is verified by Pascal's triangle. 1+3+3+1=8.
The cardinality of S(S) is (n, 0) + (n, 1) + (n, 2) + ... + (n, n) where n is the cardinality of S and (n, a) is n choose a.
</pre>
</p>
<p><b>Problem 4</b> Let S={1,2,3,4} be the universal set. Let A = {1,2,4}, B = {3,4} and C = {1, 2}. Determine each of the following sets: A ∩ B, B ∩ C, A ∪ B, A' ∩ B, (A' ∪ C) ∩ B.</p>
<p>Solution
<pre>
A ∩ B = {4}
B ∩ C = {}
A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4}
A' ∩ B = {3}
(A' ∪ C) ∩ B = {3} 
</pre></p>
<p><b>Problem 5</b> Illustrate the De Morgan law, (A union B)' = A' intersection B',  via Venn diagrams</p>
<p>Solution 1 
<pre>
De Morgan's law can be illustrated with a Venn diagram.
A' intersection B' is illustrated by the intersection of diagonal lines with opposite slope
The crossed diagonal lines do not intersect A union B
The crossed diagonal lines intersect the complement of A union B
The crossed diagonal lines with opposite slope illustrate A' intersection B'
The intersecting diagonal lines illustrate A' intersection B'

<p><b>Problem 6</b> Illustrate the distributive law, (A intersection B) union C = (A union C) intersection (B union C), via Venn diagrams.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ataylor89/calculusofonevariable/blob/main/ch1sec1prob6.jpg">Solution</a></p>
<p><b>Problem 7</b> Explain what differences (if any) there are in the following sets: ∅, {∅}, S(∅), and S({∅}).
Solution
<pre>
S(∅) = {A | A ⊂ ∅} = {∅} since the empty set is a subset of every set.
S({∅}) = {A | A ⊂ {∅}} = {∅, {∅}}
